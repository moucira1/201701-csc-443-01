  1. Personal Website — HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript, hosted on GitHub Pages
  * Data Visualization — HTML, CSS, advanced JavaScript, hosted on GitHub Pages
  * CRUD Web Application — HTML, CSS, advanced JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL or MongoDB, hosted on Heroku

## Materials

### Textbooks

There are no required textbooks for this course. Online resources pertaining to the topics at hand will be shared with students as applicable.

### Software

This course requires students to use numerous software packages. Every effort will be made to make available all required packages on assigned lab computers, but students are encouraged to install the software on their personal computers as well to achieve a more location-flexible development environment.

#### Text Editor

Each student is expected to achieve proficiency using a text editor of choice. Ideally, the text editor should include syntax auto-completion functionality for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The official text-editor for this course is [Atom](https://atom.io/), however [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) are also viable options.

#### Browser

Each student is expected to achieve proficiency using a modern browser for web development purposes. The browser must include the ability to inspect underlying elements on the page. The official browser for this course is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), however [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/) is another viable option.

#### Local Web Server

Each student is expected to achieve proficiency using a local web server of choice for web development purposes. This course recommends using Python to run a local web server, however there are many other viable options.

#### Command-line Utilities

The following command-line utilities will be covered throughout the course of the semester:

  + Git
  + Node.js and Node Package Manager (NPM)
  + Choice of either MongoDB or PostgreSQL
  + Heroku Toolbelt

## Learning Community

The maximum enrollment for this class is 20 students per section.

Michael Rossetti ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikerossetti), [GitHub](https://github.com/s2t2)) will be administering the course and teaching all course material. If you have a question about assignments, projects, or anything covered in class, email Professor Rossetti at [rossettim1@southernct.edu](mailto:rossettim1@southernct.edu). The professor aims to provide an average email response time of under two business days. If emailing the professor, please use your university-issued email address.

There is no Teaching Assistant assigned to aid instruction of this course.

## Evaluation

Student learning will be evaluated primarily through submission of take-home "portfolio" projects, as well as by submitting evaluations of peers' projects and taking a final exam. Final grades will be calculated by weighted average according to the following structure:

Name | Weight
--- | ---
[Projects](/PROJECTS.md) | 65%
Assignments (project peer evaluations)| 15%
Final Exam | 20%

## Schedule

The class meets on Thursday nights from 7:35pm to 10:05pm during the spring semester effective 1/17/17 through 5/12/17.

The [Schedule](SCHEDULE.md) contains a tentative
 week-by-week description of the topics and technologies covered in each class,
 as well as assignments given and due.
 It is likely to change to reflect the pace of instruction.

The course google calendar is available in [HTML](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=6bhqmlmku3drrf2qcvataik8e4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York) and [iCal](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/6bhqmlmku3drrf2qcvataik8e4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) format. It reflects the most up-to-date scheduling information, including class times, instructor office hours, holidays, and more.

> Note: The last day for course withdrawals is March 26th, 2017.
